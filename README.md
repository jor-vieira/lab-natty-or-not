Natural or Fake Natty? How to Succeed in the Age of Generative AIs

📒 Description
My project delves into the intersection between reality and artificiality in the age of generative artificial intelligence. Exploring the notion of authenticity, I conducted a photo shoot with celebrities wearing pajamas, creating an intimate and relaxed atmosphere. The images were carefully processed to challenge the viewer's perception of what is natural and what is artificial.

🤖 Technologies Used
Night Café Studio for image editing
Generative artificial intelligence models for creative inspiration

🧐 Creation Process
The process began with the selection of recognized personalities in various fields. Next, I organized photo sessions in a comfortable environment, where celebrities were portrayed in pajamas, symbolizing authenticity and relaxation. The images were manipulated in Night Café Studio to add elements of naturalness and artificiality, challenging the audience's perception.

🚀 Results
The final result was a series of images that provoke reflections on the growing influence of generative artificial intelligence. By questioning the authenticity of the images, viewers are encouraged to reflect on how technology is shaping our understanding of reality and identity.

💭 Reflection
Creating something "natty" (natural) in an era dominated by artificial intelligence presents unique challenges. As generative AIs become more sophisticated, the line between the real and the artificial becomes increasingly blurred. As creators, it is crucial to explore this intersection and stimulate conversations about the boundaries of authenticity and the influence of technology in our lives.
